# Json Web Token Spring Boot Starter for gRPC
Configure JWT issuers like in the Spring Boot Starter sibling project.

## Usage 

> Servlet containers and Netty use different threading models. So directly applying Spring Security is too risky given the use of the `ThreadLocal` in `SecurityContext`; authorization can be leaked between requests. However with the subset of Spring Security supported in the this library, the only real difference is using method calls instead of annotations to enforce permissions.

The authorization tokens are parsed by a gRPC interceptor and passed along using the gRPC request context. Enforce  authorization (manually) using utility methods from the `GrpcAuthorization` interface:

```
requireAllAuthorities("read", "modify");
```

To access the token directly, use

```
JwtAuthenticationToken authentication = getToken();
```

### Anonymous access
Anonymous access must be explicitly configured:

```
entur:
  authorization:
    permit-all:
      grpc:
        services:
          - name: org.entur.jwt.spring.grpc.test.GreetingService
            methods:
              - unprotected
              - unprotectedWithOptionalTenant
```

### MDC logging
If you have added MDC log mappings, 

```
entur:
  jwt:
    mdc:
      enabled: true
      mappings:
      - from: iss
        to: issuer
      - from: azp
        to: azp
```

Use the `GrpcJwtMappedDiagnosticContextMapper` to populate and clear the MDC.

```
GrpcJwtMappedDiagnosticContextMapper.addContext();
try {
    // your log statements here
} finally {
    GrpcJwtMappedDiagnosticContextMapper.removeContext();
}
```

### Example
For a code example, see the `GreetingController` example in the test sources.
